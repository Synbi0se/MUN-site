                            This is a remarkable viaduct, 600 meters long with 50 arches reaching 52 meters in height. Designed by architect Eugène Decomble, it was built in just 15 months between 1855 and 1856 to allow the railway to access the upper part of the city. The construction site employed 2,500 workers and 300 horses. Partially destroyed in 1944, it was quickly rebuilt. The viaduct is a symbol of the city, having been featured in several films. In 2012, it was given spectacular lighting.

This square tower, 19 meters high, was built in the 12th century and has retained its medieval appearance with thick walls. Initially defensive, the donjon lost a floor and served as a prison until 1886, leaving engraved inscriptions on its walls. It is accessible on request through the Médiévalys association. Nearby, there is a medieval-inspired garden and a path along the old ramparts.

                            The Basilica of Saint-Jean(Saint John), located in the heart of the old medieval city, was initially built in the early 13th century, with part of the facade and nave still preserved. Over the centuries, additions were made, including a portal in the 14th century and side chapels between the 15th and early 16th centuries. The transept and choir, rebuilt between 1517 and 1543, combine flamboyant Gothic elements and early Renaissance. The basilica's furniture is remarkable, including a Tomb (late 15th-early 16th century), works by Jean-Baptiste Bouchardon, a Tree of Jesse from the 1530s, 16th-century murals, and paintings from the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The basilica also houses a 1872 Cavaillé-Coll romantic organ, with a case dating from the second half of the 18th century.

                            The Jesuit chapel, built between 1629 and 1640 thanks to donations from local families, is a typical example of Jesuit architecture. Its interior is richly decorated, with a monumental altarpiece by Claude Collignon and a high relief added in the 19th century by Jean-Baptiste Bouchardon. The facade was redone in 1817 by architect Mangot. Next to the chapel is the Bouchardon fountain, in homage to the sculptor Edme Bouchardon. After the Revolution, the chapel served as a place of worship for the first high school in Chaumont and now hosts contemporary art exhibitions, being open to visitors in the summer.

                            The turrets, emblematic of Chaumont, intrigue passersby who explore the old town. Once very numerous, about thirty remain today, not counting those hidden in courtyards. These structures, studied in architecture schools, vary in shape (square or circular) and style (with or without roofs, simple or decorated facades). Some even house statuettes in niches. Built to optimize public space, the turrets served as entrance vestibules and stairways to the upper floors.

                            The town hall of Chaumont, built between 1787 and 1790, replaced the old Barle tower, which had become too small for the municipal administration of a town of 6,200 inhabitants. Designed by architect François-Nicolas Lancret, the building reflects the spirit of the time with its straight lines, regular curves, and sober symmetry. A model, displayed at the Museum of Art and History, shows the initial plans, including a small theater, abandoned during the Revolution. Listed in the supplementary inventory of Historic Monuments, the Town Hall has been illuminated since 2012 to highlight the elegance of its facade.

Using cast iron, this innovative material made it possible to create vast spaces with large glass openings. The Market Halls were erected on the site of an old grain market, itself built in 1799 on the site of the Saint-Michel church, demolished the same year. This church, dating from the 14th century and expanded in the 17th century, had served as a prison and military store during the Revolution. The Market Halls, renovated in 2004, now host various events, including a food market every Saturday morning.

Plus tard, l'architecte Claude Forgeot réduit et reprend les plans, et la reconstruction est terminée en 1765. La façade sobre est marquée par une entrée monumentale de la chapelle, avec des bâtiments symétriques de chaque côté. À l'intérieur, la chapelle présente une nef à deux travées menant à un chœur circulaire surmonté d'un dôme. Un retable en bois doré, réalisé par Bouchardon vers 1730, orne le chœur.

                            The Arse tower, vestige of the gate of "la Voie-de-l'Eau" and part of the second fortification belt of the XVIe siècle, was setting the entrance of Chaumont. Once arsenal of the town, it became a backery and acquired again by the city in 1985. Refurbished, it gets back its initial appearance, with a terrific wooden framework. The tower is build up against a 200 meters high fortification wich link to the bastion of the castle.
